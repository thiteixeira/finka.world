    <h2>Company history</h2>
    <p>
      The idea of this company originated initially with considering of building
      a sports performance phone app. With countless brainstorming ideas to
      build this app a section for education and highlighting
      health-professionals in the field was considered for customers to see and
      access specific information. The content and thought of this section
      became too large. Healthcare providers deserve their own platform was the
      initial thought. Next, I considered why would professionals come onto this
      platform when they can promote themselves. The answer was clearâ€¦to come
      together to help others pursuing to be like us and make an impact similar
      fields of work.
